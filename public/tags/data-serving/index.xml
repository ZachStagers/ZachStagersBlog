      <description>This post is a bit of an exploratory one, collecting some thoughts about features which combine to make a good data lakehouse serving layer, and the things to consider when choosing a resource to serve your data.
I do not intend for this post to act as a guide for choosing the right serving layer, but instead it&amp;rsquo;s an introduction to the subject and some things to watch out for as you identify which tool would be best for you.</description>
