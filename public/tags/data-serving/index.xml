      <description>I blogged previously on my thoughts about what makes a good lakehouse serving layer - the functionality and features to consider when trying to identify the right serving tool for you.
In this post I want to go a step further and do a direct comparison of some of the more obvious Azure based lakehouse serving tools - Synapse Serverless, Databricks SQL, and Synapse Dedicated. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to include Dedicated here, as although it defeats the purpose of the lakehouse paradigm, I&amp;rsquo;m still often asked whether it&amp;rsquo;s suitable.</description>

      <description>This post is a bit of an exploratory one, collecting some thoughts about features which combine to make a good data lakehouse serving layer, and the things to consider when choosing a resource to serve your data.
I do not intend for this post to act as a guide for choosing the right serving layer, but instead it&amp;rsquo;s an introduction to the subject and some things to watch out for as you identify which tool would be best for you.</description>
