      <description>This years arcade-themed SQLBits is taking place between March 8th and 12th. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to SQLBits a number of times, it&amp;rsquo;s always great fun and I come away having learned a ton!
However, this year is a little different from me, as I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting for the first time! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it a lot, the last time I presented at a community event was on Azure Notebooks back in July 2018 (as seen in the banner image)!</description>
