      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a client to build a large Data Lakehouse platform predominantly using Databricks as a processing engine and Synapse Serverless to serve the data out in a couple different ways.
This was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d properly used Synapse Serverless in anger, and to say I found the documentation around lake access confusing would be an understatement! Everything I needed to understand was spread over a few different articles, which I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to at the bottom of this post.</description>

The ACL permissions on offer are:
 Read - Grants read access to files and folders (i.e. able to see the contents). Write - Grants write access to files and folders. Execute - Grants&amp;hellip; execute.</description>
