      <description>Data and AI Summit 2022 I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely buzzing after attending my first Data and AI Summit (DAAIS) in San Francisco last week (June 27th to 30th). Incredible key notes, fantastic venue and city, good people, and awesome after parties! Huge thank you to everyone at Databricks for putting the event together, and to Advancing Analytics for giving me the opportunity to attend.
As I sit on my flight home, mind racing over the events of the week, I wanted to be productive and write up some of the key announcements and share some initial thoughts.</description>
