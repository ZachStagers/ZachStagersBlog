      <description>Data and AI Summit 2022 I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely buzzing after attending my first Data and AI Summit (DAAIS) in San Francisco last week (June 27th to 30th). Incredible key notes, fantastic venue and city, good people, and awesome after parties! Huge thank you to everyone at Databricks for putting the event together, and to Advancing Analytics for giving me the opportunity to attend.
As I sit on my flight home, mind racing over the events of the week, I wanted to be productive and write up some of the key announcements and share some initial thoughts.</description>

      <description>This years arcade-themed SQLBits is taking place between March 8th and 12th. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to SQLBits a number of times, it&amp;rsquo;s always great fun and I come away having learned a ton!
However, this year is a little different from me, as I&amp;rsquo;ll be presenting for the first time! I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it a lot, the last time I presented at a community event was on Azure Notebooks back in July 2018 (as seen in the banner image)!</description>
