This post is a bit of an exploratory one, exploring some thoughts about features which combine to make a good serving layer in general, with some specific ideas around serving a data lakehouse (i.e. a data warehouse stored in a lake!)

### What is a serving layer?

Simply put, a serving layer is a method of presenting data to users. 

But when you break that simple statement down, there's a lot to think about! What data is being presented back, and who is it being presented to? Assuming they have a choice, how do users want to connect to the serving layer? And when they've connected, how do we ensure they only see the data they're supposed to see? How much data is there? How many users do we expect to be connecting?

Taking the answers to these questions, we can build a picture of our requirements, and therefore the features we need to think about and what makes a good serving layer.
