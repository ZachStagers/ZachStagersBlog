This years [arcade-themed SQLBits](https://arcade.sqlbits.com/) is taking place between March 8th and 12th. I've been to SQLBits a number of times, it's always great fun and I come away having learned a ton!

However, this year is a little different from me, as I'll be presenting for the first time! I'm looking forward to it a lot, the last time I presented at a community event was on Azure Notebooks back in July 2018 (as seen in the banner image)!

### Pre-Con: A Data Engineers Guide to Synapse Analytics

Alongside [Simon Whiteley](https://twitter.com/MrSiWhiteley) and [Stijn Wynants](https://twitter.com/SQLStijn), I'll be presenting a full day of Synapse training on Tuesday the 8th of March!

It'll be an action packed day covering:

* Fundamentals of a lake based data platform
* Patterns for ingesting data and orchestrating your data platform execution
* How SQL Serverless Pools work and patterns for optimising performance and cost
* Using Spark Pools to write dynamic workflows in Python
* Utilizing Data Explorer Pools for deep exploration of logs, time series and other fast-moving unstructured data sources
* Integrating Synapse directly with tools such as Azure Purview and CosmosDB

### Session: Synapse Data Flows - Will Citizen ETL Replace the Data Engineer?

As well as the pre-con, I'll be presenting my own much shorter 20-minute session on Synapse Data Flows on Saturday the 12th of March, taking a look at how they measure up when compared to bespoke-built data platform. What's the pipeline reusibility like? How well can you clean and standardize your data? What are they good at, and what are they bad at?
