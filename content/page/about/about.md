### My Career 

{{< images "../page/about/zach_stagers_about_sqlbits2022.jpg" "Zach Stagers SQLBits 2022" "right" "Presenting at SQLBits 2022">}}

I've been working with data platforms and related technologies since 2008 and have built platforms on everything from SQL Server 2000 through to ultramodern Data Lakehouses using Databricks in Azure. 

My day job as a Principal Consultant with [Advancing Analytics](https://www.advancinganalytics.co.uk/) is extremely diverse, and covers many subject areas and technologies. We predominantly focus on data engineering and data science projects, typically delivering data lakes and python, instead of servers and SQL... Although SQL was definitely my first true love. I'm enormously passionate about my job, and love doing cool and exciting things with data!

My intention with this site is to share my technical findings, to serve as a catalog of some of the things I've worked on, and to contribute to the fantastic data community... and as a reminder to myself of how to fix tricky problems I've faced before in my career! 

### Offline  {{< images "../page/about/zach_stagers_about1.jpg" "Zach Stagers Great South Run 2019" "right" "Great South Run 2019">}}

Currently I live in the south coast of England, but I grew up in the Cambridgeshire area before moving to Washington state in the US and having the opportunity exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

Away from work I spend a great deal of time out and about with my camera and hiking, typically trying to capture images of landscapes or animals. If you'd care to, you can see some of my photographs [here](https://www.istockphoto.com/portfolio/ZachStagers).

I also thoroughly enjoy cooking (and eating), I'm a big sports fan, love to travel, and watch lots of film & television.
