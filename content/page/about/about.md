### My Career

I've been working with data platforms and related technologies since 2008 and have touched everything from SQL Server 2000 through to ultramodern Data Lakehouses using Databricks in Azure.

My day job as a Principal Consultant with [Advancing Analytics](https://www.advancinganalytics.co.uk/) is an extremely diverse role, and covers many subject areas and technologies. We predominantly focus on data engineering and data science projects, delivering our projects using data lakes and python, instead of servers and SQL... I'm enormously passionate about my job, and love doing cool and exciting things with data!

My intention with this site is to share my technical findings, to serve as a catalog of the things I've worked on, and to contribute to the fantastic data communities... and as a reminder to myself of how to fix tricky problems I've faced before in my career! 

### Offline

I currently live in the south coast of England, and away from work I spend a great deal of time out and about with my camera, typically trying to capture images of landscapes or animals.

I also thoroughly enjoy cooking (and eating), am a big sports fan, love to travel, and watch lots of film & television.
