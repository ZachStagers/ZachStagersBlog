### My Career 

{{< images "../page/about/zach_stagers_about_sqlbits2022.jpg" "Zach Stagers SQLBits 2022" "right" "Presenting at SQLBits 2022">}}

I've been working with data platforms and related technologies since 2008 and have built platforms on everything from SQL Server 2000 through to ultramodern Data Lakehouses using Databricks in Azure. 

My day job as a Principal Consultant with [Advancing Analytics](https://www.advancinganalytics.co.uk/) is extremely diverse, and covers many subject areas and technologies. I'm enormously passionate about my job, and love doing new and exciting things with data!

My intention with this site is to share my technical findings, to serve as a catalog of some of the things I've worked on, and to contribute to the fantastic data community... and as a reminder to myself of how to fix tricky problems I've faced before in my career!
