Iâ€™m an ambitious Microsoft and Databricks certified data analytics professional with over 10 years experience working with Microsoft data platforms and related technologies.

During this time I've gained valuable experience in data engineering, modelling, and analysis, as well as requirement gathering and project leadership.

My role is extremely diverse, and covers many subject areas and technologies. I'm enormously passionate about my job, and love doing cool and exciting things with data!
